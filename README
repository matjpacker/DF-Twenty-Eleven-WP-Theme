=============================

This is a child theme for WordPress's default Twenty Eleven theme, customized for the DFLL plugin. 

To install, make sure you have Twenty Eleven installed in a folder called "twentyeleven" (or edit style.css to point it to the right place). Then, add this folder to your themes folder, and activate the theme. 

To add in the 'Daring Fireball' style link posts you'll need to install the Daring Fireball Linked List plugin via http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/daring-fireball-linked-list/

More specific instructions will be added in the coming days.
